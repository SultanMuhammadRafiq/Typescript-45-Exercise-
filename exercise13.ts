// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

let myVehicles=["Honda Motorcycle", "Honda Civic","Honda Accord","Honda City","Honda Civic Orial"];
console.log(`“I would like to own a  "${myVehicles[0]}"`);
console.log(`“I would like to own a  "${myVehicles[1]}"`);
console.log(`“I would like to own a  "${myVehicles[2]}"`);
console.log(`“I would like to own a  "${myVehicles[3]}"`);
console.log(`“I would like to own a  "${myVehicles[4]}"`);
