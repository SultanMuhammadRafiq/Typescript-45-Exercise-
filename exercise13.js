// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
var myVehicles = ["Honda Motorcycle", "Honda Civic", "Honda Accord", "Honda City", "Honda Civic Orial"];
console.log("\u201CI would like to own a  \"".concat(myVehicles[0], "\""));
console.log("\u201CI would like to own a  \"".concat(myVehicles[1], "\""));
console.log("\u201CI would like to own a  \"".concat(myVehicles[2], "\""));
console.log("\u201CI would like to own a  \"".concat(myVehicles[3], "\""));
